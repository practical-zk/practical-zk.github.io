We built this website to act as a crowdsourced pool of knowledge of how ZKPs are being integrated into the real world. Alongside this, we wanted to provide developers and researchers a platform to advertise their papers and products. This website was built by Nojan Sheybani and Farinaz Koushanfar at the University of California, San Diego.
