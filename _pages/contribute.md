We invite everyone to contribute to this website by submitting a pull request [here](https://github.com/practical-zk/practical-zk.github.io){:target="_blank"}. After careful review, all accepted changes will be merged into the main repository. Please ensure all PRs are built using the following steps:

###### ZKPs in the Real World

1. Create an author profile by adding your information in `config.yml` (line 15). Profile images can be uploaded to `./assets/images/{yourname}.png`
2. Create a new post in `./_posts/` using the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.md`. We provide a template at `./_posts/2024-03-27-template.md`.
3. Set the `hidden` attribute to `false` at the top of your file. Do not worry about `featured` - we will rotate the featured posts regularly.
4. Write your post! Images can be uploaded to your own custom folder at `./assets/images/{new folder}`.
5. Create a pull request. We will review and accept the changes, or reach out with any questions.
