StarkEx offers a customizable ZK-Rollup solution for scaling specific Ethereum applications. It utilizes STARK proofs to achieve high transaction throughput and lower gas fees compared to the mainnet.

Unlike Starknet, StarkEx is a permissioned system, offering a curated environment for specific use cases. This approach allows for tailored optimizations and streamlined integration for supported applications.
