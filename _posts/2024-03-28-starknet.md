Ethereum's scalability limitations hinder its wider adoption. Enter Starknet, a permissionless ZK-Rollup solution built on STARK proofs. This innovative layer-2 network enables significant transaction throughput and cost reduction for Ethereum applications. 

Developers can leverage Starknet's native Cairo language to deploy smart contracts and interact with existing Ethereum infrastructure. This fosters a familiar development environment for building scalable and secure applications.
