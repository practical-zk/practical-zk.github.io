Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer tremendous potential for secure and privacy-preserving verification. However, complex ZKP applications can suffer from slow proof generation and verification times.

ICICLE emerges as a solution. This open-source library leverages GPU acceleration to significantly enhance ZKP performance. By utilizing CUDA and the LE library, ICICLE optimizes elliptic curve cryptography, a critical component of many ZKP schemes.The resulting speed improvements empower developers to implement ZKPs in real-world applications with stricter performance requirements.
